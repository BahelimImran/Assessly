# 🧠 Assessly AI — RAG Knowledge Assistant

Assessly is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered Knowledge Assistant** that enables users to **upload documents and ask intelligent, context-aware questions**.

Built with a modern full-stack architecture, Assessly transforms static PDFs into **interactive knowledge systems** using semantic search and LLM-based reasoning.

## 🧠 RAG Pipeline Architecture

### ⚙️ Components

* 📄 **Chunking**
  Custom semantic + title-aware chunking using `unstructured.partition.pdf`
  Preserves document structure and context continuity

* 🧠 **Embeddings**
  Nomic AI (`nomic-embed-text`) via Ollama
  Optimized for high-quality semantic similarity

* 🗂 **Vector DB**
  ChromaDB with metadata filtering
  Enables efficient retrieval and traceability

* 🔍 **Retrieval**
  Top-K similarity search (cosine similarity)
  Hybrid ranking (vector + keyword) for improved relevance

* 🤖 **LLM (Generation)**
  Ollama (Mistral / LLaMA)
  Generates grounded answers from retrieved context

* 🧩 **Orchestration**
  LangChain pipeline for ingestion, retrieval, and response generation

## 📄 PDF Processing Strategy

Assessly uses a **layout-aware parsing approach** to extract structured content:

```python
def parse_pdf(file_path: str):
    elements = partition_pdf(
        filename=file_path,
        strategy="hi_res",
        infer_table_structure=True,
        include_page_breaks=True,
        chunking_strategy=None,
    )
    return elements
```

### ✅ What We Extract

* Headings (Title-aware)
* Paragraphs (Narrative text)
* Lists
* Basic tables
* Page structure (for context preservation)

> 🚧 OCR (for scanned PDFs) is not enabled yet but planned in future releases.

---

## 📄 Supported PDF Types

### ✅ Recommended

* Digitally generated PDFs
* Text-based documents (copy/paste works)
* Structured reports with headings and paragraphs
* Educational materials (books, notes)

### ⚠️ Partial Support

* PDFs with simple tables
* Documents with limited images (non-critical)

### ❌ Not Recommended

* Scanned PDFs (image-based)
* Handwritten documents
* Image-heavy PDFs (charts/diagrams as core content)
* Complex multi-column layouts (research papers, magazines)
* Financial/complex tabular reports

> 💡 Tip: If you can **select text in the PDF**, Assessly will work best.

---

## 🎯 Accuracy Expectations

* 🟢 High → clean, structured PDFs
* 🟡 Moderate → mixed content (text + tables)
* 🔴 Limited → scanned or image-heavy PDFs

### 🚀 Upcoming Improvements

* OCR support
* Image & diagram understanding
* Advanced table parsing
* Layout intelligence
